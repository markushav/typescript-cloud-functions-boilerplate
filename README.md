# Boilerplate for Typescript + GCP Cloud Functions + GCP Cloud Build

This is a quick and dirty boilerplate that includes a dev server for developing Cloud Functions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and deployment process using GCP Cloud Build.

To develop, run "npm run install", "npm run dev". To deploy, go to GCP Concole, create project, head to Cloud Build, connect your repository and create a trigger that will automatically deploy your cloud functions.

More detailed instructions of the deployment process might follow later, but trust me: you can do it.
